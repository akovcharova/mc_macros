#### McM scripts

Examples of scripts for basic commands can be found in:
  /afs/cern.ch/cms/PPD/PdmV/tools/McM/

For additional available commands, see rest.py in the above folder.

Before using scripts, one needs to obtain an SSO cookie:
  source /afs/cern.ch/cms/PPD/PdmV/tools/McM/getCookie.sh

To test scripts, use the McM dev instance (https://cms-pdmv-dev.cern.ch/mcm/) using the command:
  mcm = restful(dev=True)
